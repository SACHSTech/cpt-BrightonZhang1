# ICS4U CPT: Average Annual Energy Consumption

This data represents the amount of energy consumed per person in 10 different countries annually. The data shows the trend of energy consumption over the years, as technology becomes mroe and more energy efficient. Though the energy consumption over the years has roughly stayed the same, each country's usage has dipped a small amount every since the 2000's due to technological advancements. I chose this graph because of the impact energy has on us and the environment. This graph gives insight for people to realize how much energy they are using on a annual basis. This helps combat the large amounts of greenhouse gases being emitte, and many other global problems we have in our modern world.
